EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Client is a 47-year-old Elite Standard customer with a total AUM of AED 11.9M focused entirely on fixed-income investments. No immediate maturing products, but the KYC document is expiring in one month.

• Follow-up on identified AECB triggers.
• Address portfolio rebalancing by 45% for alternative investments, 15% into Equities and Fixed Income, and 25% into Money Market assets.

RM STRATEGY SUMMARY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This client is actively managed within the 'Elite Standard' Wealth Management Segment, showcasing solid financial stability with a current AUM of AED 11.9M. The client presents a balanced risk profile (R4) and exhibits opportunities for diversification within their portfolio. With a documented CASA decline of 70% and a concentration in fixed-income holdings, rebalancing strategies can introduce higher growth-driven assets such as alternative investments and equities. Addressing the current AECB alerts and the absence of comprehensive insurance coverage will be key in securing long-term stability and flexibility.
