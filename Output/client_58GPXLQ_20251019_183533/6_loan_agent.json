      "product_name": "FAB Credit Card Consolidation Loan",
      "justification": "The client has five active alerts associated with credit card facilities, some involving opened credits of up to AED 355,000. With high lending capacity of AED 241,151.97 and a manageable DTI of 19.9%, restructuring these debt obligations into a personal consolidation loan would optimize their financial position and potentially reduce overall interest costs."

      "product_name": "FAB Personal Loan",
      "justification": "Given the clientâ€™s significant lending capacity of AED 241,151.97 and manageable debt-to-income ratio of 19.9%, offering a personal loan could cater to unknown liquidity needs while maintaining beneficial financial health for future endeavors."
    }
  ],
  "Agent_Recommends": "The client enjoys a robust annual income of AED 1,200,000 with significant but manageable obligations and a prudent DTI of 19.9%, indicating a healthy financial standing. However, seven AECB alerts related to credit cards and communication services require attention, hinting at potential over-extension or unresolved queries. Recommended products are a FAB Credit Card Consolidation Loan to address card-related inquiries and a Personal Loan to support any additional liquidity needs effectively."
