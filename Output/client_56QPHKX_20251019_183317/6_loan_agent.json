      "justification": "The client currently has a negative outstanding debt related to a personal loan, and recent credit card inquiries suggest early stages of financial planning adjustments. With an excellent debt-to-income ratio and notable lending capacity of AED 551,640, a restructured personal loan could optimize financial management."
    }
  ],
  "Agent_Recommends": "The client has a strong financial profile, indicated by a negative DTI ratio resulting from high annual income and stable CASA balances. While the client has three AECB alerts—for a personal loan and two recent credit card inquiries—options for loan restructuring or further predictable investments should suffice to optimize the financial strategy. A personal loan addresses current consolidation needs effectively."
