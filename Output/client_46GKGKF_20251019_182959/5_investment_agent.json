  "Agent_Recommends": "The clientâ€™s current portfolio heavily emphasizes fixed income, which is underperforming by a negative return of -2%. To align with the client's high risk tolerance (R6), I recommend reallocating a substantial portion of the AED 5,971,598 into equities such as the Schroder International Selection Fund targeting Asian markets and direct equity like EOG Resources Inc. This reallocation enhances portfolio diversification and potential returns."
