  "Agent_Recommends": "As the client currently holds no active investments, there is significant opportunity to align portfolio distribution with target asset allocation goals, including 25% in money markets, 15% fixed income, 15% equities, and 45% in alternative investments, while ensuring risk alignment with the R4 profile. An immediate focus on diversified funds could serve the dual purposes of moderate risk and sustainable returns."
