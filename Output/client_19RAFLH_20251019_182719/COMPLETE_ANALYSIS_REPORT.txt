Risk Appetite: R4
Risk Level: 4/6
Risk Segment: balanced

Investment Guidelines:
Balanced growth strategy aligned with client's preferences for moderate risk tolerance.

Investment Themes:
  • Focus on technology sector equities with high market capitalization and promising PE ratios.
  • Evaluate fixed-income securities due to the stable bond yields and favorable economic outlook.

# SECTION 5: INVESTMENT STRATEGY
####################################################################################################

Recommended Investment Products:
1. Schroder International Selection Fund Asian Equity Yield A Distribution USD MF

2. Emirate of Dubai United Arab E (Government Bond Fixed, ISIN: XS1062038143)
   Justification: This government bond provides a relatively secure investment (classified as AAA rated) and aligns with the client's risk-taking capacity, contributing to the targeted 15% allocation to fixed-income investments.

Investment Agent Recommendations:
Client 19RAFLH currently holds no investments, relying solely on a CASA account with no idle cash identified.

2. FAB Credit Line Facility
   Justification: To maintain financial flexibility and address recent CASA outflows, a Credit Line Facility ensures access to funds whenever needed, helping the client manage unexpected expenses or investment opportunities.
